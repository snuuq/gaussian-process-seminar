  abstract  = {Bayesian optimization is a methodology for optimizing expensive
               objective functions that has proven success in the sciences,
               engineering, and beyond. This timely text provides a
               self-contained and comprehensive introduction to the subject,
               starting from scratch and carefully developing all the key ideas
               along the way. This bottom-up approach illuminates unifying
               themes in the design of Bayesian optimization algorithms and
               builds a solid theoretical foundation for approaching novel
               situations. The core of the book is divided into three main
               parts, covering theoretical and practical aspects of Gaussian
               process modeling, the Bayesian approach to sequential decision
               making, and the realization and computation of practical and
               effective optimization policies. Following this foundational
               material, the book provides an overview of theoretical
               convergence results, a survey of notable extensions, a
               comprehensive history of Bayesian optimization, and an extensive
               annotated bibliography of applications.},
